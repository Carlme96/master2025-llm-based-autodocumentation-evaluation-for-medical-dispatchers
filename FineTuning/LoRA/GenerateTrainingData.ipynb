    "1. **Condition**  \n",
    "   - Definition: Internal, subjective physiological or psychological states felt by the patient. These are **not visible** or measurable from the outside.  \n",
    "   - Key idea: What the patient **feels**, not what others can see.\n",
    "   - Examples: \"difficulty breathing\", \"chest pain without injury\", \"feeling confused\", \"hallucinating\", \"dizzy\", \"unconscious\", \"general weakness\", \"mental health problems\", etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Observation**  \n",
    "   - Definition: External, visible, or measurable signs of illness or injury. These are based on what can be **seen**, **measured**, or **directly reported** through inspection.  \n",
    "   - Key idea: What others can **observe**, measure, or describe based on visible signs.  \n",
    "   - Examples: \"swollen ankle\", \"broken bone\", \"rash\", \"vomiting\", \"burned lips\", \"fever\", \"bleeding\", \"visible bruising\", \"open wound\", \"blistered skin\", \"severe leg pain with visible bruising\", etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cause**  \n",
    "   - Definition: The **external event** or **triggering mechanism** that led to the emergency. This explains **why** the situation is occurring.  \n",
    "   - Key idea: A specific real-world **incident or exposure** that explains the condition or observation.  \n",
    "   - Examples: \"fell down stairs\", \"car accident\", \"overdose\", \"scalding with hot water\", \"electrical shock\", \"ingested cleaning fluid\", \"assaulted\", \"injuries due knife\", etc...\n",

    "- If criterion describes **pain or a subjective symptom** without mentioning a **specific body part or injury**, classify it as **\"Condition\"**.\n",

    "- If criterion refers to an **external event** or **incident** that likely caused the condition or symptoms, classify it as **\"Cause\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Classification Instructions:\n",
    "- Carefully analyze each criterion and determine its **most defining feature**: internal experience, observable sign, or external cause.\n",
    "- Use only the **criterion number** when assigning to a category.\n",
    "- Each number must be listed **once only**, under the most appropriate category.\n",
    "- If a criterion is ambiguous, assign it to the category that best reflects the **nature or origin** of the issue, based on the category definitions.\n",
